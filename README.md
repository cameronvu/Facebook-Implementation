# Facebook Implementation
This program acts as the backend of the Facebook application adapted in Java. 
This project closely simulates a social media platform in which users are 
able to create account and maintain friendships with other users. The program
uses a custom-build graph object with uses vertices and edges to represent 
a web of mutual user friendships, which may be managed (terminated, initiated)
by the user if they so desire. This program also utilizes an extension of the Thread
class, so files may be uploaded, read, and interpretted accordingly by the program.
A project like this serves as the backbone for the inner-workings of many 
social media apps that we use today. A front-end portion or GUI may be easily
added and adapted to make a more complete application. For a more extensive
summary of the technical portions of this project, see the in-file 
documentation.
