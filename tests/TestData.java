    // because we don't even know what kind of Collection the methods will
    // return.  This method takes a Collection to check and another Collection
    // with the expected values (this Collection will actually be some type of
    // List).  Then it uses the Collection containsAll() method to compare the
    // two parameter Collections.  If we have two collections A and B, and A
    // contains all of the elements of B, and B contains all of the elements
    // of A, then it must be the case that they must have all the same
    // elements, and only the same elements.  Of course this is not
    // particularly efficient, but our goal is just to make it easy to check
    // the results of tests.
