// (c) Larry Herman, 2024.  You are allowed to use this code yourself, but
// not to provide it to anyone else.

/* To avoid having to include too many data files in everyone's CVS
 * repository, or use up too much disk space with data files, the last three
 * public tests create data files, write randomly generated user data to
 * them, call your readSocialNetworkData() method using the randomly
 * generated data files, and then remove the data files afterwards.  They do
 * this using two static auxiliary helper methods that are defined in a
 * class FileCreator, which is included in a jarfile that is part of the
 * project distribution (named FileCreator.jar).  The helper methods also
 * return a data structure containing the information in the files, so tests
 * can use the data structure to check that your readSocialNetworkData()
 * method is creating threads to read the data files correctly.  These
 * helper methods are written so although the user and friend relationships
 * are randomly generated, the same random data will be created every time
 * these tests are run.  (The methods use what is called a pseudorandom
 * number sequence.)  This means that if you want to look at the files that
 * are created (see below for how) you can be confident that the files will
 * be created with the same contents every time these tests are run.
 *
 * The first method is
 *
 *   static List<String> createUserFiles(int numFiles, int numUsers,
 *                                       int maxUserSuffix, String baseName)
 *
 *   It creates numFiles different files that have only user additions
 *   (lines with adduser).  There will be numUsers total user additions in
 *   all of the files.  The names of the users will all begin with "person"
 *   and will have a suffix between 1 and maxUserSuffix appended (for
 *   example person1, person2, etc.).  The files will all start with the
 *   string baseName and have a suffix between 1 and numfiles appended.  For
 *   example, if numFiles is 2, numUsers is 18, maxUserSuffix is 100, and
 *   baseName is "test", this method will create two files, each with nine
 *   "adduser" lines, containing 18 randomly generated user names between
 *   "person1" and "person100", and the two files will be named "test1" and
 *   "test2".  There will not be any duplicated user additions in the files.
 *
 *   The method returns a list of strings which are the names of all of the
 *   users in the created files, in a random order.
 *
 * The second method is
 *
 *   static HashMap<String, List<String>> createFriendFiles(int numFiles,
 *                                                          int numUsers,
 *                                                          int numFriends,
 *                                                          int maxUserSuffix,
 *                                                          String baseName)
 *
 *   It creates numFiles different files that have only friend additions
 *   (lines with addfriends).  There will be numFriends total friend
 *   additions in all of the files, between numUsers different users.  The
 *   names of the users will all begin with "person" and have a suffix
 *   between 1 and maxUserSuffix appended (for example person1, person2,
 *   etc.).  The files will all start with the string baseName and have a
 *   suffix between 1 and numfiles appended.  For example, if numFiles is 3,
 *   numUsers is 20, numFriends is 45, maxUserSuffix is 80, and baseName is
 *   "afile", this method will create three files, each with fifteen
 *   "addfriends" lines, containing 20 randomly generated user names between
 *   "person1" and "person80", and the three files will be named "afile1",
 *   "afile2", and "afile3".  The friend relationships in the created files
 *   (or the returned HashMap) will not have any duplicates and there will
 *   not be any friend relationships in the files that are between the same
 *   person.
 *
 *   The method returns a map whose keys are the names of all of the users
 *   in the friend relationships in the files, and the value for each key is
 *   a list of the names of all of the other users who they are friends with
 *   in the files.  If a and b are friends then b will be in the list with a
 *   as a key, and a will be in the list with b as a key.
 *
 * If you want to see the data structures that are returned by these methods
 * you can look at them in the Eclipse debugger, or print them using
 * toString().
 *
 * If you want to see the data files that are created by the tests that use
 * these methods, without them being deleted when the tests finish, just
 * change the value of KEEP_INPUT_FILES to true at the beginning of the
 * class below and rerun the tests.
 *
 * You can use these methods in writing your own tests if you want.
